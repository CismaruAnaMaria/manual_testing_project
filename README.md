The scope of the final project is to use and show all the knowledge I have learned through the course and from self research and to apply them when using a live application.
* Application under test: [XYZ Bank](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login)

I have created my own documentation in order to find bugs and static testing issues. The application come without any original documentation.
