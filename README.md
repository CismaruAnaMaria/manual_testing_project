# Final Project for IT Factory Manual Testing course

The scope of the final project is to use and show all the knowledge I have learned through the course and from self research and to apply them when using a live application.
* Application under test: [XYZ Bank](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login)

I have created my own documentation in order to find bugs and static testing issues. The application come without any original documentation.
* Documentation: [Documentation for XYZ Bank](https://github.com/CismaruAnaMaria/manual_testing_project/blob/main/Documentatie%20pt%20xyz%20bank.docx).

The final project will be split into 2 sections: **Testing section** (where tracking process will be done in Jira and Zephyr tools) and the **SQL Section**. The testing section will also contain  2 section, GUI testing and Api testing that will be done in Postman tool.
     
Tool used: **Jira, Zephyr Squad, Postman, SQL Workbench, Github.**

# Functional Specification
* The business requirments can be found [here](https://github.com/CismaruAnaMaria/manual_testing_project/blob/main/Documentatie%20pt%20xyz%20bank.docx).

The **XYZ Bank** application it's an application created for the usability both of the costumers and the bank manager. With this app the customer should be able to check his bank account and see the transactions he has made over one period, the credit balance and he can deposit or withdrawal money to and from his bank account.
